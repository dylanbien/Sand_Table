# ConferenceSandTable

The intention of the project is to serve as a conference table for companies to hold meetings on!

When plugged in, the lights turn on, fading in and out through different colors
Simultaneously, a gear train underneath begins to rotate circularly
Connected to this are magnets that can move in and out

Users see a ball being pulled by the magent through the sand and has been programmed to draw designs.

The designs include spirals as well as shapes (where an alogrithm was written to convert our polar corrdianate system into cartesian)
